# Tournament Prize Distribution Contract

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
Tournament Prize Distribution Contract

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This smart contract is designed to securely and transparently distribute prize money among winners of a tournament. It is deployed with a total prize pool and allows the tournament organizer (contract owner) to distribute funds to specified winners in fixed amounts.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
To create a decentralized, trustless, and efficient mechanism for prize disbursement in competitive events such as esports tournaments, hackathons, or any prize-based contests.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can trigger prize distribution.
- **Fair Distribution**: Ensures the total distributed amount does not exceed the prize pool.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can check the prize amount awarded to any participant.
- **One-Time Distribution**: Prizes can only be distributed once, preventing re-entry or duplicate rewards.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Add functionality for sponsors to contribute to the prize pool.
- Allow dynamic addition of winners post-tournament.
- Integration with off-chain tournament platforms using oracles.
- Support for ERC20 tokens instead of just native cryptocurrency.
